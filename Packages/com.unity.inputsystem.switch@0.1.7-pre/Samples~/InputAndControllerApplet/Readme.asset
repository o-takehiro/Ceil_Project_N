  title: Input and Handling Controller Configurations Sample!
  sections:
  - heading: Overview
    text: "This Sample is intended to provide an overview and example use cases of
      functionality specific to Nintendo Switch. For information about how to use
      the Input System more generally across all platforms, please refer to the Samples
      and Documentation included with the Input System Package.\r\n\r\nThe Sample
      includes one Scene that shows up to 4 connected controllers and shows the properties
      of those controllers, including:\r\n\_- Connection Status of each/any JoyCon\r\n\_-
      The Buttons pressed on the controllers\r\n\_- The Colour of each JoyCon of
      a controller\r\n\_- The controller style (e.g. FullKey, LeftJoycon, DualJoy,
      etc.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Sample demonstrates:\r\n\_- How to set the haptics
      per JoyCon or each motor on a Pro Controller\r\n\_- How to use the Controller
      Applet\r\n\_- How to respond to changes in Controller Style/Orientation within
      and outside of the Controller Applet"

  - heading: Interacting with the Sample
    text: "When pressing any JoyCon button, the corresponding button will appear
      on the screen. However, you can press certain buttons to interact with different
      elements of the Sample; they are:\r\n\r\n\_- +(Plus) or -(Minus) to launch
      the Controller Support Applet\r\n\_- Left or Right Stick to play a Haptic through
      the corresponding JoyCon"

  - heading: Changeable Elements of the Sample
    text: 'The Sample allows you to change the types and styles of controllers supported.
      In the BasicControls scene on the GamepadManager object, you can change the
      Play Style field to a different version of the Controler Config Style Scriptable
      Object; see more in the Scripts section. You can choose from an existing Config
      or create your own; the existing Configs are in the Prefabs/Config folder.
      The existing Configs cover common gameplay scenarios:



      4 Player Configurations:

      -
      4Player_All - Allows 1 - 4 Players with non-handheld JoyCons (i.e. not docked
      to the Console) in any configuration allowed with the JoyCons in Horizontal
      mode

      - 4Player_Dual - Allows 1 - 4 Players with either Dual Joycons
      (not docked to the Console) or a Full Key Pad (i.e. a Pro Controller)

      -
      4Player_Single_Horizontal - Allows 1 - 4 Players with a Single Joycon each
      in Horizontal Mode

      - 4Player_Single_Vertical - Allows 2 - 4 Players
      with a Single Joycon each in Vertical Mode



      Single Player Configurations:

      -
      Singleplayer_AllControllers - Allows 1 Player in either Handheld (i.e. JoyCons
      docked to the Console), FullKey (i.e. Pro Controller) or DualJoy styles

      -
      Singleplayer_Handheld - Allows 1 Player only with the JoyCons attached to the
      Console in Handheld Mode

      - Singleplayer_RemoteControllers - Allows 1
      Player only with JoyCons detached from the Console, either DualJoy or a FullKey
      pad





      You can change the Amplitude/Frequency of the Haptics by changing
      the values of the GamepadHaptics component on the Controller prefab in the
      Prefabs folder.'

  - heading: Scripts
    text: 'The scripts of the Sample are divided based on the functionality they
      demonstrate; this may not be the best practice for your game. The contents
      of each script are:



      - ControllerConfigStyle is a Scriptable Object
      that holds properties relating to the possible configurations that you might
      want in a game, including NPad Styles, Hold Type, Player Count and if Single
      Player Mode should be used for the Controller Applet



      - ControllerSupportApplet
      is a static class that shows the Controller Support Applet using the OpenControllerApplet
      function with the player count parameters



      - GamepadManager is a Manager
      script that keeps all SampleGamepads updated on the screen. It deals with the
      initial setup of the HID library (using the Nintendo SDK plugin) using the
      information provided by the assigned ControllerConfigStyle. When devices are
      added or removed from the InputSystem, it handles the hiding/unhiding of the
      device representations in the Scene



      - SampleGamepad is a container
      class that holds the device and actions for a given Gamepad representation
      in Scene. It links to the PlayerInput component of the PAD prefab to get input
      from the assigned device and InputActions asset. Furthermore, it deals with
      changing the assigned device when the configuration is changed



      - GamepadDisplay
      displays the buttons pressed on the Gamepad on the screen and other visual
      properties of the controller: Controller Style, Joycon Colours, and whether
      each JoyCon is connected.



      - GamepadHaptics triggers haptics on the
      JoyCons when the Left or Right Sticks are pressed on the appropriate Joycons



      -
      NpadHelpers provides helpful functions for getting the Slot Displayed on screen
      from an NPad ID and finding an NPad device from a given NPad ID'
