  title: Control Scheme Sample!
  sections:
  - heading: Overview
    text: "This Sample is intended to provide and overview and example of how to
      handle changing the Control Scheme when the Controller Style is changed, in
      this case the changes are between a DualJoy/Handheld/FullKey pad and a Horizontal
      Left or Right Single JoyCon. For a general cross platform example of how to
      use Control Schemes, please refer to the Samples and Documentation included
      with the Input System Package. \r\n\r\nWhile this example only uses 1 Controller,
      the sample theory can be applied to a game with multiple controllers."

    text: 'When pressing a button on the Controller that is bound to an action in
      the Input Action asset, a log of the Actions current phase (Started/Performed/Canceled)
      will be logged on the screen.



      You can press either +(Plus) or -(Minus)
      to launch the Controller Support Applet.'

  - heading: Input Actions
    text: "The Sample includes the \"Controls\" Input Action asset that defines the
      input actions that you would typically find in a basic first person shooter:
      Jump, Shoot, Move, Reload and Aim. \r\n\r\nThe Input Action asset contains
      three control schemes for three different modes that the game expects the player
      to use: Full Pad, Joy Left & Joy Right. These schemes define the controls that
      should be used when the controllers are in the appropriate mode. Note that
      they are not automatically switched to when the controller mode is changed,
      this is done in the RebindingPad script.\r\n\r\nThe controls for each control
      scheme are:\r\n\r\nFull Pad:\r\n\_- Jump = Button East (This is bound to whatever
      button is East on the Dpad/XABY pad when the Single Joycon is the correct way
      up. When using DualJoy/Handheld/FullKey (Pro Controller), this is assigned
      to A on the XABY pad)\r\n\_- Shoot - ZR\r\n\_- Move - Left Stick\r\n\_- Reload
      - R\r\n\_- Aim - ZL\r\n\r\nJoy Left:\r\n\_- Jump = Button East (See note above)\r\n\_-
      Shoot - SR (Left) - The (Left) represents the Left JoyCon \r\n\_- Move - Left
      Stick (this will be the only stick when using a Single JoyCon)\r\n\_- Reload
      - Button West (Assigned to the west button on the JoyCon)\r\n\_- Aim - SL (Left)
      - The (Left) represents the Left JoyCon \r\n\r\n Joy Right:\r\n\_- Jump = Button
      East (See note above)\r\n\_- Shoot - SR (Right) - The (Right) represents the
      Right JoyCon \r\n\_- Move - Left Stick (this will be the only stick when using
      a Single JoyCon)\r\n\_- Reload - Button West (Assigned to the west button on
      the JoyCon)\r\n\_- Aim - SL (Right) - The (Right) represents the Right JoyCon
      \r\n\r\n From the controls list above, you can see that it is possible to reuse
      some controls across configurations without any modification (for example,
      the sticks will automatically rotate their values when used in horizontal mode)
      and allows some controls to be changed where it either makes for a better playing
      experience or if a critical control is not available on the different configuration."

    text: 'The scripts of the Sample are divided based on the functionality they
      demonstrate; this may not be the best practice for your game. The contents
      of each script are:



      - ControllerSupportApplet is a static class that
      shows the Controller Support Applet using the OpenControllerApplet function
      with the player count parameters



      - GamepadDisplay updates the onscreen
      representation of the Controller depending on its Style.



      - RebindingPad
      initializes the state of the pads to support a single player with the correct
      JoyCon styles and IDs. When a device is changed (e.g. the Style changes) or
      is added or removed it switches to the correct control scheme within the InputSystem'
